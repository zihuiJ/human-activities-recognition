# human-activities-recognition

This is a paper about my statistical classification project. The project trains three classifiers on human body monitoring data that predict what activities they are doing. The result can potentially be used on detecting and tracking activities with fitness device. The project is done with Python, R, with scikit-learn and pytorch.
